How to use:
- Drag the GCCalendar folder from this project into the top level of your Xcode project tree.  Make sure "copy items…" and "recursively create…" are selected.
- Import the GCCalendar.h header file anywhere you would like to use the calendar API.
- Overwrite the contents of calendarEventsForDate: in GCCalendar.m to provoke the calendar UI with a list of events to display.

Known issues (v1.0):
- Events that have start and end dates not on the same day may behave unexpectedly.
- Touches on the calendar tiles do not reflect the touch in the user interface.
- The body of calendarTileTouch: in GCCalendarPortraitView is intended to let the developer push a detailed event view onto the navigation stack, currently no such view exists
